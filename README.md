# Scaling-Bitcoin

- **Scaling Bitcoin**

  I made these slides to try to explain the Bitcoin and Lightning Network scalability problem to a group of students, in the first BitGeneration cycle (Feb-2023). 
  
  I upload the files here in case they might be useful to anyone in the future. 

  These slides were reviewed by Giacomo Zucco.

- **Lightning Network in 21'**

  Presentation made for the format called "21 minutes" of the italian bitcoin meetup Satoshi Spritz of Turin. 
  The slides explore the differences between the various Lightning wallets and what variables to consider to make an informed choice
